Create a login page for CV Creator Tool Platform. When the user clicks on the button to submit, a modal with the current date and time should appear to state when the user's session is starting. When a user clicks on the start session button of the modal, they should be redirected to the landing page. There should be a counter for the session duration. When a user clicks on the sign out button, a modal with their total session duration should be displayed. After closing that modal, the user should be redirected to the login page once again. You can create pages from scratch or modify existing pages from Week 6.
