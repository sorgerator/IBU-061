You will build a landing page for the CV Creator Tool platform that we’ve been working on so far.  You will use Bootstrap components mentioned in the lab above (navigation, buttons, modals, etc.) and their different classes. When the user clicks on the “Notifications” button, a modal as seen below should open. Implement page redirection so when users click on the “Sign In”, or “Register” button they are taken to that page. Also implement navbar navigation (subsection search inside the same page). Inside the Locations section, figure out how you can embed an actual Google Maps map. Navbar should be collapsible to the menu icon. Using Bootstrap classes set the background to light color, as well as text in the “About CV Creator Tool” to green color.  Include a collapsible menu in the “Frequently Asked Questions” section. Figure out how you can implement a vertical group of three buttons of different sizes, states and colors. Add a footer as well.
