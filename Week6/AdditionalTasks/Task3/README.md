Create a pricing page. Here, you should have three large badges to represent different user statistics. Below you should create a striped table that will contain all users pending or received purchases (or subscriptions). Received purchases should have a “Cancel” button - when you click on it, the modal to cancel subscription to a certain service should appear. Pending purchases should have a “Delete” button. After clicking on it, a modal with a cancel/delete message should appear. Next to the “My Profile” button, add a toggle switch for Notifications.
