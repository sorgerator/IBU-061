When the user clicks on the register button, they will be redirected to the Registration page. This is an adaptation of the previous HTML registration form, however here we’re using Bootstrap components and their classes. Include Bootstrap validation for form fields. Also include a striped progress bar in the bottom with percentage values. Once again, put the background color to light. Include navigation and footer as well.
