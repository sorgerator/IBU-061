1. Embed audio and video files on a webpage.
Embed an MP3 file with audio controls:
Use the correct element to embed an audio MP3 file (burch.mp3).
That element should include controls for play, pause, and volume adjustments.
Embed a video file with a poster image:
Use the correct element to embed a short video file (intro-video.mp4).
The video element should include controls for play, a poster image (video-poster.jpg) that will be shown before the video starts. (add width="700" height="500")
Implement autoplay and mute functionality for the video element:
Ensure the video automatically starts playing when the page loads by adding the needed attribute to the video element.
Mute the video by default.
