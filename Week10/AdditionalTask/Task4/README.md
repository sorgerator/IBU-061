Build a JavaScript program that performs two sequential API calls using promises. Write a function called fetchUserPosts that first fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and then uses the user ID from the fetched data to fetch corresponding posts from the posts endpoint (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). Chain the promises using .then() to handle both responses and log the user names along with their posts.
