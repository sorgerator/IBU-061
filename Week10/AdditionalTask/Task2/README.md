You should use the RemoteOK API (https://remoteok.com/api) to fetch and display remote job opportunities. You need to use the existing landingPage.html from Week 6,  and update it by adding a "View Remote Jobs" button. When clicked, this button opens a new tab that redirects users to the RemoteOK website (https://remoteok.com). 
Additionally, you need to implement an asynchronous function named fetchJobListings using async/await to dynamically fetch job data from the API. The job listings are displayed in a dedicated section (jobs-container) on the page, with each job presented as a styled card containing details such as the job title, company name, description, and a link to apply. Robust error handling is incorporated to manage issues such as network failures or API errors, ensuring a user-friendly experience by displaying appropriate error messages if the job data fails to load.
