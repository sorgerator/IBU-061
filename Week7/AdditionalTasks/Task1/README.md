Use Tailwind CSS to style the "Features" page of the CV creator tool. Start by setting up a responsive layout with a headline section at the top and a grid section below that displays the tool’s features. Design the grid to adapt from a single column on small screens to three columns on larger screens. Each feature card should contain an icon, a title, and a brief description. Apply Tailwind’s grid, spacing, and text alignment utilities to create a balanced layout. Use background colors, padding, and hover effects on each card to make it visually appealing and interactive.
