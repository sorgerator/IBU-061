Create a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) section for our CV generator tool. The FAQ section should present a list of common questions with their corresponding answers. The layout should be responsive, using Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring it adapts well across different screen sizes. Each FAQ item should be collapsible, allowing users to click on a question to reveal or hide the answer. While the primary styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 5’s collapse component will be utilized to provide the interactive functionality for expanding and collapsing the answers. This will ensure a smooth user experience, with clean animations and a modern look. Additionally, the section should include ample spacing and clear typography for readability, making it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
